It contains both ARM Cortex-A9 and Artix-7 FPGA inside one chip.  \r\n[Xillinux](http://xillybus.com/xillinux) is running on ARM which is Linux distribution dedicated for this board. It already has interfaces for communication with FPGA in the form of FIFOs in /dev directory.  \r\nFPGA can be easily programmed without knowing VHDL, Verilog or any other HDL. There is a tool called [Vivado HLS](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado/integration/esl-design.html) which transforms program written in C to HDL and later synthesizes it to FPGA configuration.\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loruro/Zynq_FPGA_Median_Filter/master/img/diagram.png\" width=\"379\"/></div>  \r\nMedian filter is a digital filter often used in digital image processing for noise removal.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nThis implementation uses version of median filter where each of RGB channel is median filtered separately.\r\n\r\nFor receiving image from webcam and displaying filtered result I used ARM side of Zynq SoC. Camera was connected to the board by USB and display by VGA. Xillinux automatically recognized both devices.  \r\nTo read frames from webcam I used [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) library. Also I used it for splitting images to separate RGB channels before sending them to FPGA and for adding some artificial noise to image because original frames from webcam were too clear to see results of the filter.  \r\nColor channels were being sent to FPGA and simultaneously processed ones were being received. Those received channels were being assemblied back to entire frames also with help of OpenCV and finally displayed on the screen.  \r\nAll of this was done by [this](https://github.com/loruro/Zynq_FPGA_Median_Filter/blob/master/Xillinux/main.cpp) program.\r\n\r\nOn FPGA there was a simple [implementation](https://github.com/loruro/Zynq_FPGA_Median_Filter/blob/master/FPGA/main.c) of median filter which receives each row of pixels and using three of them generates row of filtered pixels.\r\n\r\n## Result\r\n\r\n| <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loruro/Zynq_FPGA_Median_Filter/master/img/original.jpg\" width=\"320\"/> | <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loruro/Zynq_FPGA_Median_Filter/master/img/filtered.jpg\" width=\"320\"/> |\r\n| :------------------------------------------: |:---------------------------------------:|\r\n| Original (artificially noised) | Filtered |\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://loruro.github.io/\"><sub>⟵ Back</sub></a>",
